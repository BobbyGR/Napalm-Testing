# Napalm-Testing
# Programmed with Windows 10, Python 3.7

This is the best program I have written so far, hopefully you like it.

Public_Napalm_Testing v0.4.py main source code you run. mynapalmfunctions.py is a object required to run Public_Napalm_Testing v0.4.py. 

Testing Napalm framework, it outputs the Juniper's running config/interface data and outputs this to a multiple text files and then creates a folder with the serial # + date of action. Then moves all files to this folder. Next step is to include the hostname.

This right now is just the start of working with the Napalm framework for my codes.
