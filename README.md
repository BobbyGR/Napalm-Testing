Public_Napalm_Testing_v0.6.py main source code you run. mynapalmfunctions.py is a object required to run Public_Napalm_Testing_v0.6.py.

Testing Napalm framework, it outputs the Juniper's running config/interface data and outputs this to a multiple text files and then creates a folder with the serial # + date of action. Then moves all files to this folder. Next step is to include the hostname.
