# Napalm-Testing
# Programmed with Windows 10, Python 3.7
Testing Napalm, it outputs the Juniper's running config/interface data and outputs this to a text file

Right now the output is dirty and NOT HUMAN readable well okay it is but it will take some time to read it, VERY UGLY OUTPUT! I want to clean up the code but the wife is demanding my attention! That is why it is version 0.1.

This right now is just the start of working with the Napalm framework for my codes.
