# Napalm-Testing
# Programmed with Windows 10, Python 3.7
Testing Napalm framework, it outputs the Juniper's running config/interface data and outputs this to a multiple text files and then creates a folder with the serial # + date of action. Then moves all files to this folder. Next step is to include the hostname.

This right now is just the start of working with the Napalm framework for my codes.
